### HW 2

First program using GO, implemented a program that derives expressions from an AST tree and tranlates units when performing calculations.

### H3

Programmed in LISP. Implemented many small lisp functions, pattern matching routing, and matrix operations. Most LISP programs involved recursion.

### HW 4

Programmed in Prolog. Implemented many queries and predicated manipulation. Also used prolog to solve Wolf, Goat, Cabbage, and Farmer crossing Puzzle.
